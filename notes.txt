Loading contacts

1) Look in the type registry for a solid:instance with solid:forClass vcard:AddressBook
2) Dereference that resource
3) Look for the addressbook with vcard:nameEmailIndex <someresource>
4) Dereference that resource

Here's how it would look as a swaddle query

[
  {
    _from: typeRegistryURI,
    _type: solid.TypeRegistration,
    [solid.forClass]: vcard.AddressBook
  },
  solid.instance, [
    vcard.nameEmailIndex, [
      vcard.fn
    ]
  ]
]

- to know which resources to load:
  - (static):
    - parse query for:
      - the _from property of the params
  - (dynamic):
    - when an edge resolves to a vertex which is a name not in the current graph set, load that name



where
  _from: typeRegistryURI
  _type: solid.TypeRegistration
  [solid.forClass]: vcard.AddressBook

get
  solid.instance {
    vcard.nameEmailIndex {
      vcard.fn
    }
  }
